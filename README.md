This is a code copy of our proposed Multi-scale feature fusion with attention mechanism for software defect prediction (MFA) model. 
train_mode2 is model training and prediction.
MFA is the model structure, and dat is the deformable transformer. 
PROMISE contains the dataset and related word embedding files.
